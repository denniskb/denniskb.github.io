#    I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

    "Spice" is a state of the art spiking neural network simulator written in C++ and CUDA. It
    - is up to 3x faster than the competition,
    - allows you to specify your own models through a modern and intuitive API (you simply inherit from a model base class and override callbacks),
    - builds out of the box without any 3rd-party dependencies (apart from CUDA), and
    - does not involve any proprietary compilation steps or domain-specific languages.

    We estimate human poses by treating them as missing/incomplete rows in a "pose database" matrix and calculating missing entries via matrix completion.

    [KinectFusion](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/kinectfusion-project-page/) is a well-known 3D scanner powered by Microsoftâ€™s Kinect camera. It has recently found its way into the official [Kinect for Windows SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561). While KinectFusion produces very high-quality scans in real-time, it is limited to relatively small spaces.

    In this paper we extend KinectFusion with a sparse data structure and streaming, allowing us to scan areas of virtually infinite size while maintaining the quality and performance of the original algorithm.

    Voxels date back [20 years](http://advsys.net/ken/voxlap.htm). They have many advantages over polygon meshes. However, they always suffered form the lack of a hardware-accelerated rendering pipeline and the infeasiblity of animating them. I tackled this age-old computer graphics problem in my BSc thesis. The (GPU-accelerated) animation technique I developed enables:
    
    - Skeletal animation of voxels models
    - Rendering of mixed polygon- and voxel-based content.
